# ImpactAI – AI-Based Damage Classification Tool for Textile Reinforced Composites

**ImpactAI** is a lightweight, browser-based tool developed as part of the academic research project _"Design and Development of an Impact Damage Tester for Textile Reinforced Composites"_ by **Ashish Hulle**.

This tool leverages computer vision to classify modes of damage in impacted textile-reinforced composites using uploaded images. It supports rapid, automated, and preliminary analysis to aid researchers, manufacturers, and testing laboratories.
